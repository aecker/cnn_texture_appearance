# Code and data for "A parametric texture model based on deep convolutional features closely matches texture appearance for humans" by Wallis et al.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/86071293.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/86071293)

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the results of 

Wallis, Funke, Ecker, Gatys, Wichmann and Bethge (submitted). A parametric texture model based on deep convolutional features closely matches texture appearance for humans. 

Stimuli can be found in a complementary archive (ref; stored separately due to license restrictions on images).

* `code` = code for generating stimuli, running experiment, and analysing data.
* `documentation` = some testing protocols and subject demographics
* `figures` = some figures from the paper (data figures produced by the `knitr` document, which will be uploaded upon acceptance)
* `raw_data` = raw data from the experiments.
* `results` = processed data from the experiments.

## Experiment labelling

Note that Experiment 1 from the paper corresponds to `experiment_11` in the code and Experiment 2 in the paper corresponds to `experiment_12` in the code. We ran related but separate experiments that were stored in the same repository. I've kept the code as-is to reduce the need to relabel directories.

To run the code in your own setup you will need to adjust top directory paths to the relevant path on your local machine.
