  title = {Functionally Partitioning the Ventral Stream with Controlled Natural Stimuli},
  abstract = {The visual areas of the primate cerebral cortex provide distinct representations of the visual world, each with a distinct function and topographic representation. Neurons in primary visual cortex respond selectively to orientation and spatial frequency, whereas neurons in inferotemporal and lateral occipital areas respond selectively to complex objects. But the areas in between, in particular V2 and V4, have been more difficult to differentiate on functional grounds. In previous work (Freeman, Ziemba et al., Nature Neurosci, 2013), we showed that, in both macaque and human, synthetic stimuli whose higher-order statistical properties emulated natural texture images yielded differential responses in V2, but not V1. We have now examined responses to these stimuli and to photographs of objects and scenes, to better distinguish the properties of V2 from those of the areas that provide its input and receive its output. We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses while human observers viewed rapidly presented images, while performing an attentionally-diverting task at fixation. We measured BOLD responses while presenting stimuli drawn from different stimulus classes in alternating blocks. We used three classes: photographs of scenes and objects, texture images matched to the higher-order statistics of these photographs (specifically, the spatially-averaged distribution and correlations of model V1 outputs, Portilla \& Simoncelli, 2000), and noise images matched only to the overall orientation and frequency content of the photographs. As we found previously, fMRI responses to textures were larger than those to noise in V2, V3, and to some extent V4, but not in V1, and not in inferotemporal and lateral occipital areas thought to be selective for complex objects. In contrast, responses to photographs were larger than those to noise in those higher areas, as well as in V2-V4, but not in V1. The differentiation between V1 and V2, however, was less robust than for the more controlled, homogenous textures. Finally, comparing responses to photographs and textures revealed differential activity in higher areas, but little or no differential responses in V1-V4. Together, these three comparisons offer a simple functional account of the visual cortical cascade. Whereas V1 encodes basic spectral properties, V2, V3, and to some extent V4 represent the higher-order statistics of textures. Downstream areas capture the kinds of global structures that are unique to images of natural scenes and objects.},

  title = {Modeling Psychophysical Data at the Population-Level: The Generalized Linear Mixed Model.},
  volume = {12},
  abstract = {In psychophysics, researchers usually apply a two-level model for the analysis of the behavior of the single subject and the population. This classical model has two main disadvantages. First, the second level of the analysis discards information on trial repetitions and subject-specific variability. Second, the model does not easily allow assessing the goodness of fit. As an alternative to this classical approach, here we propose the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The GLMM separately estimates the variability of fixed and random effects, it has a higher statistical power, and it allows an easier assessment of the goodness of fit compared with the classical two-level model. GLMMs have been frequently used in many disciplines since the 1990s; however, they have been rarely applied in psychophysics. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the issue of estimating the point-of-subjective-equivalence (PSE) within the GLMM framework has never been addressed. Therefore the article has two purposes: It provides a brief introduction to the usage of the GLMM in psychophysics, and it evaluates two different methods to estimate the PSE and its variability within the GLMM framework. We compare the performance of the GLMM and the classical two-level model on published experimental data and simulated data. We report that the estimated values of the parameters were similar between the two models and Type I errors were below the confidence level in both models. However, the GLMM has a higher statistical power than the two-level model. Moreover, one can easily compare the fit of different GLMMs according to different criteria. In conclusion, we argue that the GLMM can be a useful method in psychophysics.},

  abstract = {Many of the commonly used methods for modeling and fitting psychophysical data are special cases of statistical procedures of great power and generality, notably the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). This book illustrates how to fit data from a variety of psychophysical paradigms using modern statistical methods and the statistical language R. The paradigms include signal detection theory, psychometric function fitting, classification images and more. In two chapters, recently developed methods for scaling appearance, maximum likelihood difference scaling and maximum likelihood conjoint measurement are examined. The authors also consider the application of mixed-effects models to psychophysical data.R is an open-source programming language that is widely used by statisticians and is seeing enormous growth in its application to data in all fields. It is interactive, containing many powerful facilities for optimization, model evaluation, model selection, and graphical display of data. The reader who fits data in R can readily make use of these methods. The researcher who uses R to fit and model his data has access to most recently developed statistical methods.This book does not assume that the reader is familiar with R, and a little experience with any programming language is all that is needed to appreciate this book. There are large numbers of examples of R in the text and the source code for all examples is available in an R package MPDiR available through R. Kenneth Knoblauch is a researcher in the Department of Integrative Neurosciences in Inserm Unit 846, The Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute and associated with the University Claude Bernard, Lyon 1, in France.

We employ Portilla and Simoncelli's texture synthesis algorithm, a parametric model that mimics computations carried out in human vision. We find an intriguing interaction between texture type (periodic, structured, or 3-D textures) and image statistics (autocorrelation function and filter magnitude correlations), suggesting different representations may be employed for these texture families under pre-attentive viewing.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE:It is often difficult to estimate parameters from individual clinical data because of noisy or incomplete measurements. Nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modeling provides a statistical framework for analyzing population parameters and the associated variations, even when individual data sets are incomplete. The authors demonstrate the application of NLME by analyzing data from the MNREAD, a continuous-text reading-acuity chart. METHODS:The authors analyzed MNREAD data (measurements of reading speed vs. print size) for two groups: 42 adult observers with normal vision and 14 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Truncated sets of MNREAD data were generated from the individual observers with normal vision. The MNREAD data were fitted with a two-limb function and an exponential-decay function using an individual curve-fitting approach and an NLME modeling approach. RESULTS:The exponential-decay function provided slightly better fits than the two-limb function. When the parameter estimates from the truncated data sets were used to predict the missing data, NLME modeling gave better predictions than individual fitting. NLME modeling gave reasonable parameter estimates for AMD patients even when individual fitting returned unrealistic estimates. CONCLUSIONS:These analyses showed that (1) an exponential-decay function fits MNREAD data very well, (2) NLME modeling provides a statistical framework for analyzing MNREAD data, and (3) NLME analysis provides a way of estimating MNREAD parameters even for incomplete data sets. The present results demonstrate the potential value of NLME modeling for clinical vision data.},

We constructed synthetic stimuli replicating the higher-order statistical dependencies found in natural texture images and used them to stimulate macaque V1 and V2 neurons. Most V2 cells responded more vigorously to these textures than to control stimuli lacking naturalistic structure; V1 cells did not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in humans revealed differences between V1 and V2 that paralleled the neuronal measurements. The ability of human observers to detect naturalistic structure in different types of texture was well predicted by the strength of neuronal and fMRI responses in V2 but not in V1. Together, these results reveal a particular functional role for V2 in the representation of natural image structure.},

  abstract = {Vision is an active process: We repeatedly move our eyes to seek out objects of interest and explore our environment. Visual search experiments capture aspects of this process, by having subjects look for a target within a background of distractors. Search speed often correlates with target-distractor discriminability; search is faster when the target and distractors look quite different. However, there are notable exceptions. A given discriminability can yield efficient searches (where the target seems to "pop-out") as well as inefficient ones (where additional distractors make search significantly slower and more difficult). Search is often more difficult when finding the target requires distinguishing a particular configuration or conjunction of features. Search asymmetries abound. These puzzling results have fueled three decades of theoretical and experimental studies. We argue that the key issue in search is the processing of image patches in the periphery, where visual representation is characterized by summary statistics computed over a sizable pooling region. By quantifying these statistics, we predict a set of classic search results, as well as peripheral discriminability of crowded patches such as those found in search displays.},

  volume = {41},
  abstract = {Recent research on texture synthesis suggests that characterisation of those properties of textures to which human observers are sensitive may be provided by the histograms of the coefficients of a wavelet decomposition. In this study we examined the properties of wavelet histograms that affect texture discrimination by measuring observer sensitivity to differences in the wavelet histograms of synthetic textures. The textures, generated via Gabor micropattern synthesis, were broadband, with amplitude spectra that are characteristic of natural images, i.e. 1/f. We measured texture-difference thresholds for three moments of the wavelet histograms \textendash{} variance, skew and kurtosis \textendash{} by manipulating the contrast, phase, and density, of the Gabor elements used to construct the textures. Observers discriminated more efficiently between textures that had differences in kurtosis, than between textures that had differences in either variance or skew. Performance was compared to two model observers; one used the pixel-luminance histogram, the other used the histogram of the output of wavelet-filters. The results support the idea that the visual system is relatively sensitive to the kurtosis, or 4th moment, of the wavelet histogram of textures. We argue that higher than 4th-order moments will, in practice, become increasingly difficult for the visual system to represent because the lack of a perfect match between the elements and the receptive fields effectively blurs the response histogram, thereby attenuating higher moments.},

  abstract = {Texture boundary segmentation is conventionally thought to be mediated by global differences in Fourier energy, i.e., low-order texture statistics. Here, we have examined the importance of higher order statistical structure of textures in a simple second-order segmentation task. We measured modulation depth thresholds for contrast boundaries imposed on texture samples extracted from natural scene photographs, using forced-choice judgments of boundary orientation (left vs. right oblique). We compared segmentation thresholds for contrast boundaries whose constituent textures were either intact or phase scrambled. In the intact condition, all the texture statistics were preserved, while in the phase-scrambled condition the higher order statistics of the same texture were randomized, but the lower order statistics were unchanged. We found that (1) contrast boundary segmentation is impaired by the presence of higher order statistics; (2) every texture shows impairment but some substantially more than others; and (3) our findings are not related to scrambling-induced changes in detectability. The magnitude of phase-scrambling effect for individual textures was uncorrelated with variations in their amplitude spectra, but instead we suggest that it might be related to differences in local edge structure or sparseness.},

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {Peripheral vision provides a less faithful representation of the visual input than foveal vision. Nonetheless, we can gain a lot of information about the world from our peripheral vision, for example in order to plan eye movements. The phenomenon of crowding shows that the reduction of information available in the periphery is not merely the result of reduced resolution. Crowding refers to visual phenomena in which identification of a target stimulus is significantly impaired by the presence of nearby stimuli, or flankers. What information is available in the periphery? We propose that the visual system locally represents peripheral stimuli by the joint statistics of responses of cells sensitive to different position, phase, orientation, and scale. This "textural" representation by summary statistics predicts the subjective "jumble" of features often associated with crowding. We show that the difficulty of performing an identification task within a single pooling region using this representation of the stimuli is correlated with peripheral identification performance under conditions of crowding. Furthermore, for a simple stimulus with no flankers, this representation can be adequate to specify the stimulus with some position invariance. This provides evidence that a unified neuronal mechanism may underlie peripheral vision, ordinary pattern recognition in central vision, and texture perception. A key component of our methodology involves creating visualizations of the information available in the summary statistics of a stimulus. We call these visualizations "mongrels" and show that they are highly useful in examining how the early visual system represents the visual input. Mongrels enable one to study the "equivalence classes" of our model, i.e., the sets of stimuli that map to the same representation according to the model.},

Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers.},

Here, we examined the extent to which contrast negation and texture synthesis each introduce or remove critical perceptual features for discriminating unnatural textures from natural textures. We find that both manipulations remove information that observers use for distinguishing natural textures from transformed versions of the same patterns, but do so in different ways. Texture synthesis removes information that is relevant for discrimination in both abstract patterns and ecologically valid textures, and we also observe a category-dependent asymmetry for identifying an "oddball" real texture among synthetic distractors. Contrast negation exhibits no such asymmetry, and also does not impact discrimination performance in abstract patterns. We discuss our results in the context of the visual system's tuning to ecologically relevant patterns and other results describing sensitivity to higher-order statistics in texture patterns.},

  title = {Rethinking the Role of Top-down Attention in Vision: Effects Attributable to a Lossy Representation in Peripheral Vision.},
  volume = {3},
  abstract = {According to common wisdom in the field of visual perception, top-down selective attention is required in order to bind features into objects. In this view, even simple tasks, such as distinguishing a rotated T from a rotated L, require selective attention since they require feature binding. Selective attention, in turn, is commonly conceived as involving volition, intention, and at least implicitly, awareness. There is something non-intuitive about the notion that we might need so expensive (and possibly human) a resource as conscious awareness in order to perform so basic a function as perception. In fact, we can carry out complex sensorimotor tasks, seemingly in the near absence of awareness or volitional shifts of attention ("zombie behaviors"). More generally, the tight association between attention and awareness, and the presumed role of attention on perception, is problematic. We propose that under normal viewing conditions, the main processes of feature binding and perception proceed largely independently of top-down selective attention. Recent work suggests that there is a significant loss of information in early stages of visual processing, especially in the periphery. In particular, our texture tiling model (TTM) represents images in terms of a fixed set of "texture" statistics computed over local pooling regions that tile the visual input. We argue that this lossy representation produces the perceptual ambiguities that have previously been as ascribed to a lack of feature binding in the absence of selective attention. At the same time, the TTM representation is sufficiently rich to explain performance in such complex tasks as scene gist recognition, pop-out target search, and navigation. A number of phenomena that have previously been explained in terms of voluntary attention can be explained more parsimoniously with the TTM. In this model, peripheral vision introduces a specific kind of information loss, and the information available to an observer varies greatly depending upon shifts of the point of gaze (which usually occur without awareness). The available information, in turn, provides a key determinant of the visual system's capabilities and deficiencies. This scheme dissociates basic perceptual operations, such as feature binding, from both top-down attention and conscious awareness.},

  abstract = {This book is unique in that it covers the philosophy of model-based data analysis and a strategy for the analysis of empirical data. The book introduces information theoretic approaches and focuses critical attention on a priori modeling and the selection of a good approximating model that best represents the inference supported by the data. Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected to provide an estimate of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These are relatively simple and easy to use in practice. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. Model selection, under the information theoretic approach presented here, attempts to identify the (likely) best model, orders the models from best to worst, and measures the plausibility ("calibration") that each model is really the best as an inference. Model selection methods are extended to allow inference from more than a single "best" model. The book presents several new approaches to estimating model selection uncertainty and incorporating selection uncertainty into estimates of precision. An array of examples is given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians using models for making inferences from empirical data. People interested in the empirical sciences will find this material useful as it offers an alternative to hypothesis testing and Bayesian.},

  issn = {1534-7362},
  doi = {10.1167/13.4.21},
  abstract = {Orientation signals, which are crucial to many aspects of visual function, are more complex and varied in the natural world than in the stimuli typically used for laboratory investigation. Gratings and lines have a single orientation, but in natural stimuli, local features have multiple orientations, and multiple orientations can occur even at the same location. Moreover, orientation cues can arise not only from pairwise spatial correlations, but from higher-order ones as well. To investigate these orientation cues and how they interact, we examined segmentation performance for visual textures in which the strengths of different kinds of orientation cues were varied independently, while controlling potential confounds such as differences in luminance statistics. Second-order cues (the kind present in gratings) at different orientations are largely processed independently: There is no cancellation of positive and negative signals at orientations that differ by 45$^\circ$. Third-order orientation cues are readily detected and interact only minimally with second-order cues. However, they combine across orientations in a different way: Positive and negative signals largely cancel if the orientations differ by 90$^\circ$. Two additional elements are superimposed on this picture. First, corners play a special role. When second-order orientation cues combine to produce corners, they provide a stronger signal for texture segregation than can be accounted for by their individual effects. Second, while the object versus background distinction does not influence processing of second-order orientation cues, this distinction influences the processing of third-order orientation cues.},
